# OpenDNA

OpenDNA lets you upload your DNA and search an open repositories.  
  
## Where Do I get my DNA from?
OpenDNA supports 3 sources currently: 23AndMe, Ancestry & FamilyTree.

## What are risk groups?
Certain genoset with particular rsids-values pairs are susceptible to some diseases for example: People with 
rs6025 =A AND rs1800595=C are susceptaible to Venous Thrombosis.
More information about geotypes is available at https://opensnp.org.  

## Whats our goal?
Our ultimate goal is to build a exhaustive dataset with information about various diseases/conditions. One should be able to upload his/her DNA and receive information about susceptible diseases/conditions. Of course this is a big feat and we need your help!

## How do you plan on gathering data?
We're programmers not genome experts! We plan on crowd sourcing our dataset. Once your login and register there is a option for "Add New Risk Groups". Anyone can enter rsid-value pairs. We plan to add verification soon.

## Is your service live?
This project started as a part of Meteor2015 hackathon. Its not ready for production yet but will be avaiable soon. Check this section for production version soon!

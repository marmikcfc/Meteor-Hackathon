        <h5>Where Do I get my DNA from? </h5>
        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
            OpenDNA supports 3 sources currently: 23AndMe, Ancestry & FamilyTree.
        </p>
        <h5>What are risk groups?</h5>
         <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
            Certain genoset with particular rsids-values pairs are susceptible to some diseases for example: People with rs6025 =A AND rs1800595=C are susceptaible to Venous Thrombosis. More information about geotypes is available at https://opensnp.org.
        </p>    
        <h5>Whats our goal?</h5>
         <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
            Our ultimate goal is to build a exhaustive dataset with information about various diseases/conditions. One should be able to upload his/her DNA and receive information about susceptible diseases/conditions. Of course this is a big feat and we need your help!
         </p>   
        <h5> How do you plan on gathering data? </h5>
            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
                We're programmers not genome experts! We plan on crowd sourcing our dataset. Once your login and register there is a option for "Add New Risk Groups". Anyone can enter rsid-value pairs. We plan to add verification soon.
            </p>
        <h5>Is your service live?</h5>
